# Summary
Discord RSA is a tool for encrypted communication trough discord using RSA encryption.
when creating a password it creates a public key and a private key that is used for communication.
the private key is then encrypted using your user password using AES-CBC and can only be decrypted using your password.


# Installation

You should upload your public key to a site that allows raw download (like github and pastebin). Then, you can share
the links to your public keys with whover you want to talk with.

Finally you will need to invite a Discord bot in your server and copy the server ID, chat ID, and discord bot token with 
the app.

You will now be able to use the application as a chatbox.
